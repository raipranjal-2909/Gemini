## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- A modern web browser
- Gemini API Key (You can get one from Google AI Studio or API Console)

### 📥 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raipranjal-2909/Gemini.git
   cd Gemini
   ```
2. Open index.html in your browser.

3. Add your Gemini API key in the script.js file:
  ```
  const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
  ```

## 💡 How It Works
1. User enters a query in the input box.

2. JavaScript handles the event and sends the input to Gemini API using fetch.

3. The API response is parsed and displayed in real-time on the web page.

4. The UI updates dynamically based on user interaction and Gemini’s replies.
